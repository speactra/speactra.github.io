## Hello!

Welcome to speactra.se. My name is Alexander Eriksson and is also known as the electronic music producer Speactra. Mainly this site is for posting the music that I make, and also share my thoughts and tips regarding everything around musicproducing, music I like and more. I am also hosting a Podcast, EvolQue, which you can find in the Music-section of the site.

My studio consists of a laptop, Ableton Push, Axiom 49, a Record 13c accordion, a guitar and some various flutes. The software that I am using is Ableton Live 9.
